    description:
      "Petition for disqualification filed by Ernesto Bibot A. Domingo, Jr. against Benjamin Benhur D. Abalos, Jr. , the elected mayor of Mandaluyong City, in the aftermath of the May 1998 elections. Domingo alleged that Abalos improperly influenced his father, then-mayor Benjamin Abalos, Sr., to provide financial incentives to public school teachers in exchange for support in the election. Domingo contended this amounted to vote-buying, violating Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dismissed the petition for disqualification, finding insufficient evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal, affirming the COMELEC's decision that there was no grave abuse of discretion, and that the evidence presented did not meet the threshold required to prove the alleged violations.",

    description: `anniversary episode of Wowowee, an ABS-CBN game show. The crowd, much larger than usual, was attracted by the event's big prizes, including taxis, jeepneys, and a top prize of one million pesos. Most attendees were from impoverished areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces, drawn by the show's promise of instant wealth. The event's crowd size far exceeded the typical 5,000-person attendance. Unfortunately, a crush occurred, killing 73 people and injuring around 800 others. It was initially believed that 88 had died, but this was due to double-counting by rescue workers. Most of the victims were young middle-aged women, but elderly people were also among the casualties. Senator Richard Gordon, Chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross, reported that most of the injured were not seriously harmed and many were treated and released. The Red Cross, ABS-CBN's affiliated NGOs, and the network itself led efforts in recovering bodies, providing medical care, and offering support to the victims. ABS-CBN's chairman, Eugenio "Gabby" Lopez III, promised financial assistance to the victims and their families, and the network formed the 71 Dreams Foundation to further aid the victims' relatives.`,
