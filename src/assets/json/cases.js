      "Ernesto A. Domingo, Jr. vs. Commission on Elections and Benjamin D. Abalos, Jr. G.R. No. 136587, August 30, 1999",
    description:
      "Petition for disqualification filed by Ernesto Bibot A. Domingo, Jr. against Benjamin Benhur D. Abalos, Jr. , the elected mayor of Mandaluyong City, in the aftermath of the May 1998 elections. Domingo alleged that Abalos improperly influenced his father, then-mayor Benjamin Abalos, Sr., to provide financial incentives to public school teachers in exchange for support in the election. Domingo contended this amounted to vote-buying, violating Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dismissed the petition for disqualification, finding insufficient evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal, affirming the COMELEC's decision that there was no grave abuse of discretion, and that the evidence presented did not meet the threshold required to prove the alleged violations.",
